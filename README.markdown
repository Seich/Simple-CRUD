# Simple CRUD
##This name is probably going to change later.

Simple CRUD is a very simple CRUD implementation written in PHP. It basically maps a database entry (At the moment it uses mysql but, everything is handled by a pdo object thus, could use almost any if you've got the appropriate plugin) to a php object. 

I am done with CR which means I can **Create** new entries and **Read** them. I'll start with **Update** tomorrow and probably finish **Delete** as well.
